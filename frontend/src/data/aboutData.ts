    summary:
      `As a passionate technologist, inventor, and entrepreneur, I thrive on turning bold ideas into real-world impact. I’m driven by the challenge of building transformative solutions that push the boundaries of what technology can do — and how it can change the way we work and live.

In my role as Lead AI Engineer at Salesforce, I focus on pioneering intelligent agent technologies that elevate customer experiences and drive operational excellence. From piloting new features to leading the development of Agentforce, I work at the intersection of product innovation and real-world application, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams and customers.

I bring a builder’s mindset and a forward-thinking approach to every challenge, always seeking new ways to bridge vision and execution. If you’re passionate about innovation, AI, and what’s next — let’s connect.`,
